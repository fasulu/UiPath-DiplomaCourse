What about Ngazobil?

Since the 19th century, Ngazobil has housed a Catholic mission, one of the oldest in Senegal, established by François Libermann of Saverne, founder of the Congregation of The Holy Spirit. Louis-Philippe Walter stayed there in 1867. It was also in Ngazobil that future president Léopold Sédar Senghor did his schooling until 1922. Hyacinthe Thiandoum was trained there as well. Saint-Joseph Seminary was classified as a historical monument in 2003. Ngazobil is now a common site for pilgrimages.
